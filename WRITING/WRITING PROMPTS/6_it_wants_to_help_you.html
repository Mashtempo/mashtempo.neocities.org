            <p>
                I ran. I ran as fast as I could. I couldn't look back, I didn't want to know if he was near or 
                not.<br> 
                That face, my lord, that face, that expression, those eyes. Why? Why did I marry him? I don't 
                understand, he was such a sweetheart, he took care of me. Why does he want to kill me now?<br><br> 

                I couldn't think about this nonsense, I just had to get to safety. The terror of the 
                situation didn't fully creep up on me until now, as the adrenaline rush was still strong.<br><br>

                "Owh, fuck..." A sharp sting hit my throat, with the pain finally setting in.<br>
                "That fucker..." I muttered under my breath. That drunk son of a bitch tried slicing my 
                throat while I was in bed. He almost succeeded.<br><br> 

                Darkness consumed the night sky, and the path in front of me as I hurried through the woods. 
                <i>Why didn't I just run to the police station? What am I gaining from this..?</i> I was getting 
                increasingly worried and tired, but I tried running and silencing my breaths by covering 
                my mouth with my hand.<br><br>

                My attempts were soon to be proven to be in vain, as my foot brushed over a rock in the 
                mud-covered path, and I fell nose first onto the ground.<br><br> 

                <i>Oh fuck, oh shit... no...</i> I couldn't walk anymore, there was too much pain in my body. 
                My legs gave away, and my hands started bleeding from catching myself in the fall. 
                I couldn't get up, and I accepted the horror of my fate, with my skin paler and colder than 
                before. I tried calming myself down, but my heart was beating ever so fast, and no amount 
                of exhales helped the situation.<br><br>

                I heard footsteps creeping louder and louder, and the least I could do was lay on the ground and 
                hope to God that he chose the wrong path.<br><br>

                Closing my eyes, I just wished for this nightmare to end. I <i>hoped</i> this was a nightmare, 
                a bad dream, and that I'll awake soon, to my husband delightfully greeting me.<br><br> 

                "Oh Samantha..." Echoed through the woods. My eyes widened, and I bit my tongue to stop the 
                excessive breathing. I was still extremely tired from running so long.<br><br>

                As the footsteps got closer, my attention was soon focused on that rock. It was... making 
                noise...? Well, certainly not anything loud, more like a buzzing you'd hear in your ear, 
                and the surface of the rock lit a bright green.<br><br>

                I couldn't question the insanity, I was probably hallucinating from the sheer fear of the 
                circumstance. Sill laying on the wet, muddy floor of the woods I slowly got on my front, to 
                grab the said rock, so I at least have some form of self-defense. 
                I couldn't, no, <i>I didn't</i> want to die this way.<br><br> 

                As I got closer, I noticed a quaint symbol on the rock. I reached out, and tickled its surface 
                with my fingertips, managing to barely get the rock, when...<br><br>

                "Hey, that tickles." came a sound behind me.<br>
                I wasted no time, I turned around and threw the rock, only for it to bounce off of... 
                <i>it</i>.<br><br>

                I couldn't believe my eyes. A creature, towering over me, was standing just a couple of feet 
                in front of me. Its dark-red skin resembling pure flesh, with its body seemingly intertwining 
                with itself, with pure skeleton being seen in some areas, but at the same time muscly in 
                nature. Its stomach and chest had tumor-like growths, breathing sequentially like the bubbles of 
                boiling water. The head resembled something of a canine's, with fangs poking out of the 
                mouth, its ears alerting straight up.<br>
                "Well, that was rather unnecessary." Added the... creature, brushing the area where I 
                hit it with the rock.<br><br>

                That was strange, this creature, or demon, seemed... <i>friendly?</i> The voice was unusually 
                low, but not that low for something that looks like Satan's best friend.<br><br> 

                "Who... <i>What</i> are you?" I questioned, the tone still quiet, as to somehow not alert 
                the crazed murderer of a husband. <i>Maybe, just maybe</i>, I thought, 
                <i>I'm going insane, and this is the byproduct of it.</i><br><br>

                "I'm a man of many talents." Said the creature sarcastically.<br>
                "But I'm a man who can do a lot of bad things to bad people, too, and you're lucky that 
                you're not one of those bad people."<br>
                One of my eyebrows went up. What... what in the world is this creature talking about?<br><br>
                
                "I don't really have a name, but most of my peers call me Forest, because my symbol is located, 
                well, in the forest."<br>
                Forest crouched down to look at me.<br>
                "You seem to be in some trouble, no?" I nodded as fast as I could.<br>
                "My husband is trying to murder me." I responded, with hope with my eyes. 
                I should be terrified of him, but it somehow brought me immense comfort.<br><br> 
                
                "Please, please help me. I don't want to die."<br>
                Forest got up, and looked ahead of me.<br> 
                "That crazed guy that's running around with a bloodstained knife?" He pointed his finger in a 
                direction behind me.<br> 
                I turned around, only to see him, his vision gazed on me, walking slowly 
                towards me.<br><br>
                
                <i>What the...? Can't you see that there's a 10 foot demon standing near me? 
                    Can he even see it?</i><br>
                My mind must've been read, as Forest responded.<br>
                "Nah, he can't see me. Only the person that summed me can." He said as he started walking 
                towards him.<br>
                "What a strange little guy." He murmured to himself.<br><br> 
                
                Forest used his lanky arms to grab him by the throat.<br>
                "Huh...?" A gasp from him could be heard.<br>
                "What the fuck is... happening?" He added.<br><br>
                
                Forest brought him to me. He was still slashing with his knife everywhere like a 
                madman, but Forest took the knife out of his hand and gave it to me. And, with a snap of his 
                finger, it almost looked like time stopped. Everything was frozen, covered in a 
                transparent white fabric, while only me and Forest could move.<br><br>
                
                "My deed has been done. Do whatever you want to him, and time will unfreeze as soon as you 
                enter your home." Forest said, as he started disintegrating like ash.<br>
                "I'll be back in my rock home. Please don't kick it the next time, it wouldn't be so nice if 
                I kicked your house now would it." He added as he fully disappeared out 
                of the woods.<br><br>
                
                I turned my gaze to the murderer in front of me.<br>
                "Oh, Johnny..." I said while raising the knife Forest stole from him.<br><br>

                I started first by carving my knife deep into his throat, as much as the knife had 
                let me, going across the entire length of his neck.<br> 
                I pulled back the knife, staring in awe, as I decided on what next I could do. He was 
                now like my own, little canvas.<br> 
                I went next for his eyes, stabbing them deep in the retinas and pulling them out, same with 
                his tongue.<br> 
                I reached for his torso and stabbed deep into his heart, making sure I poked right 
                through it.<br>
                Finishing off my masterpiece, I carved a smile into his stomach, along with the message 
                "I love you, Johnny <3" before setting foot back home.<br><br>

                "Johnny is no more! Johnny is no more!" I yelled along the way. He really was no more, 
                and from that day on I found a very enticing hobby, all thanks to Forest himself.
