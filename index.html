                    Although I am more known by my username <b>Mashtempo.</b> I am a video editor, along with a content creator
                    who's main focus is completion videos. I'm also a big bookworm and a learner, and I made this site not only to
                    share my ramblings about every day life, but to experiment with study hacks and habit forming as share my thoughts 
                    and feelings to see if they work or not.
