                I remember a good while ago, while my brain was still rotting from TikTok, 
                that I kept stumbling into videos where people swear by cold showers. Cold showers boost the 
                immune system, cold showers help waking you up, cold showers make you productive. It's like 
                cold showers make you a bloody super hero, and immune to any disease mankind has. So, 
                <a href="/BLOG/BLOG_PAGE_1/2_Does_Deep_Work_Really_Make_Your_Work_More_Efficient.html" target="_blank">
                    as I was writing the last blog post,</a> I thought... why not try them?<br> 
                So, I set myself a challenge: for the next 7 days, I'll be taking nothing but cold showers, 
                to see if they'll help me be more productive. Oh yeah, I should mention this, 
                <b>I'll only be talking about the productivity side of cold showers.</b> I am not a doctor, 
                I am some guy with way too much free time. Here I'll be documenting my experience with them and 
                see if they helped <b>me.</b><br><br> 
                
                Without further ado, let's begin this journey of masochism!<br><br>

                Okay, I kind of lied... Before we ACTUALLY get started, I have to answer a question you 
                probably have: <b>what do I exactly mean by productivity?</b> Well, all of these self-help 
                gurus claim that cold showers help with:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus and staying awake</li>
                <li>Your mood (the dopamine boost you get)</li>
                <li>Mental discipline</li>
                <li>Getting used to discomfort</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p class="blog-text">And I want to see if this, first off true, and secondly if this can correlate into making your 
            work easier.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Day 1</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            I honestly didn't know what to expect. I didn't want to immediately start on the coldest 
            setting possible, so I made the water warmer, but still really cold.<br><br>

            ...I showered for five minutes. I got humbled greatly. Wetting my legs wasn't the problem, 
            but when it comes to the UPPER portion of the body, especially my back... OH BOY, it felt like I had 
            to enter in a state of zen to be able to get used to it. I swear I saw Buddha when I was done.<br> 
            But one of my questions was soon answered, and that is 
            <b>my body got used to the cold water.</b> Don't get me wrong it was still uncomfortable, but 
            after some time the water doesn't feel that cold. It felt, dare I say... nice? 
            Well, it's like saying diving head first into the waters of the Arctic feels nice, but it didn't feel 
            THAT bad.<br><br>

            When it came to the "productive" side of things, I didn't notice that big of a change. 
            I felt a little bit warm when I got out of the shower, which was something that I didn't expect. 
            (Don't yell at me if this is common knowledge, biology is one of my most hated subjects in school)<br>
            But, continuing to do work did feel really nice. I thought the effects are gonna appear later on, 
            and having critical opinions on the first day felt kinda stupid. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Day 2</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            I put the water on the same setting as yesterday. I don't know, I still felt a little bit of fear 
            making it colder. Surprisingly tho, it did feel more comfortable compared to yesterday. 
            Just so I don't get called a pussy, before I hopped out of the shower, I turned the notch and made 
            it a little bit colder, and oh boy, my body responded negatively to that.<br> 
            It was like the last five minutes didn't count, and I felt the same shock I felt as if I wet my body 
            for the first time. I managed to last another two minutes before hopping off. Yeah, I couldn't 
            stand it anymore. <br><br>

            But, I did feel that I cleared my mind a little bit. I came back home, and really didn't want to 
            edit a video I was working on, and as soon as I stepped out the shower, and dried myself up, that wave 
            of uncertainty completely disappeared, and I managed to sit on my desk and begin work, no issue.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Day 3</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            This day was a fucking doozy. I came home extremely tired, just wanting to lay and sleep for a week, 
            when I decided to take a shower. And this time, I made the water colder. I know, I know, you don't 
            need to clap. Yes, I decided to put my big boy pants on (well, metaphorically, why would you shower 
            with clothes on...?), but I first started at the setting of the coldness of yesterday (referring to 
            the last two minutes), and slowly made the water colder.<br><br>

            I showered for a total of 20 minutes! Well, it was probably because I was really tired, but still, 
            20 minutes of cold water? Wim Hof must be proud.<br> 
            And, what can I say. It worked. I felt more refreshed, and awake. I felt like a new man. I managed to 
            regain the energy to code, edit, and read. I was really shocked.<br><br>

            Now, before I bullshit you by saying that I managed to work for like 15 hours straight, I... didn't. 
            I was still, you know... tired. I still had tiredness in my body, but the cold shower helped to 
            minimize it. I managed to do, what I like to call, a "1/1/1" - one hour of editing, one hour of 
            coding, and one hour of reading. Which, when you think about it, cosplaying as a corpse to being 
            able to do three hours of work is a big deal, and left me genuinely surprised. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Day 4</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Today was the day when I tried a cold plunge.<br><br>

            Well, a half-baked attempt at a cold plunge. I don't have a tub for one, but I have a bathtub!<br> 
            Honestly filling up the tub was worse than actually being in it. I didn't time it, but it must've 
            taken probably around 10 or 15 minutes for the tub to fill up. I turned the water to the coldest 
            setting, and I even grabbed a bowl to speed the process up by filling it with cold water from the 
            sink.<br><br>

            ...doing a cold plunge was a mistake.<br>
            As soon as I put one foot in, the cold water shocked me. I somehow didn't expect it to be 
            <b>that</b> cold. And it was, I think it took me around 5 minutes to be completely submerged in the 
            water.<br>
            Well, not fully submerged. I'm really tall, and the bathtub isn't really big in width to support my 
            long-ass legs. So, unfortunately, the knees had to dangle in the air.<br><br> 

            Let me tell you, this shit was <b>not comfortable</b>. Like, at all. I wanted to get out as soon as 
            the water touched my torso, but I was already halfway through with this challenge and I didn't want 
            to let this stop me, so I persisted. It really was a mental game. I was talking to myself like a 
            madman, trying to get used to the water. But eventually I did it, and it was... really boring?<br><br>

            Like I said before, once you put your body through cold water, after some time it gets accustomed to 
            it. It was the same thing here.<br> 
            The water didn't feel cold anymore. I did feel my fingertips freezing, but it wasn't cold, at all. 
            I actually swayed a little bit so the waves of the water would make me feel cold again.<br>
            So, after a whopping total of 14 minutes, I got out. I got out because I was immensely bored, 
            and the water didn't feel that cold anymore.<br><br> 

            To not be a broken record, just like yesterday, I did feel the same effects and I was way more 
            energized, but there was a side effect: I WAS BURNING LIKE THE SUN. Okay, not really, but the 
            warmth I felt as soon as I got out was unreal. Like, I couldn't believe that the result of a 
            cold plunge was your body having a conversation with Ra.<br><br>

            But, as much as I felt energized, I had to wait for like 30 minutes because my hands, and especially 
            my fingers, were stiff as FUCK. I could barely write on paper, yet alone a keyboard where I was 
            already fat fingering the keys.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Days 5, 6, & 7</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            I will group all of these in one, because it was... exactly the fucking same.<br><br> 

            I was tired -> I went to take a cold shower -> I made the water colder -> I felt uncomfortable but I 
            got used to it -> Oh wow I feel much more energized and ready for work.<br><br>

            Well, I do say that I felt uncomfortable, but that was only the first time the water had touched my 
            body, but the discomfort quickly faded away. I was used to the cold water at this point.<br><br>

            And what about the mental toughness? Well, there were battles at the beginning for sure, especially 
            during the cold plunge, but yeah I think my mind got used to the coldness, I didn't mind it at all 
            and found it really comfortable. <br>
            And, as I said before, I found myself regularly energized to be able to do more work, but I think 
            the mental toughness translated into my work, as I tried going out of my comfort zone to learn some 
            new editing tricks, and tried more complex programming concepts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Should you take cold showers? Well, now every time I want to shower, I shower with cold water. 
            For me, and especially right now in the scorching July (I mean, that's when I was doing the 
            experiment lol), and ESPECIALLY August weather, they're a GODSEND, and not only do they make me 
            feel really refreshed, I honestly really appreciate the added level of focus I get when I step out 
            of it. Now, like I said before, it's not like all of your tiredness goes away, but it is somewhat 
            drastic. Personally, I would recommend them to try it out, but please make the cold water bearable 
            at first, THEN slowly make it colder. You want to win the mental battle, right? So what's the point 
            in immediately going in with the coldest setting possible and make cleaning yourself a chore?
