                Welcome dear readers to my blog. I want to use this blog entry to introduce myself, what I do, 
                and what I want to achieve with this blog. First of all, hello, I am Danin, but you can refer to me 
                by my online username, Mashtempo. I, as a hobby, create YouTube videos about achieving 100% 
                completion in video games. I made this site for a lot of reasons. To learn programming, and to have 
                a personal portfolio that I can showcase to people, but also to start working on this blog in my 
                pass-time.     
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                So, what is this blog going to be focused on? Well, I have to give you some more background 
                information first. I am a productivity nerd, and I always look for ways to create and maintain
                good, healthy habits. On top of that, throughout my time in high school I looked for ways to 
                maximize the efficiency of my studying. All of this helped me in the last two years of my 
                high school journey to achieve a perfect grade of 5.0
                <sup title="In the country where I'm from we don't have a GPA, but we calculate the highest grade by the arithmetic mean of all the subjets we have. Therefore, I had a 5 on every single subject in the last two years of high school.">*</sup>.
                I think it's safe to say that I have a very big interest in optimizing my routine and being as productive
                as possible. On top of that, as I graduatated high school I started reading James Clear's <a href="https://jamesclear.com/articles" target="_blank">
                blog about habit forming, </a>which pushed me on to maintain mine as well. With all of that inspiration, 
                I decided to dust off my laptop, and create a personal website, with a big accent on a blog.  
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                If you couldn't tell, this blog is going to be centered around productivity. I want to try a lot of 
                strategies when it comes to forming habits, and studying, and share the results on this blog. This can 
                include a lot of stuff: information I find online via YouTube or some other site, tips I read from books, and 
                just stuff I want to try out of personal curiosity that I haven't found anywhere, but want to try and experiment 
                to see if they're going to be useful. To add on, I also want to review the books I read<sup title="it's self-help lmao">*</sup> 
                and say if they're worth buying them or not. Although, I have to preface this by saying that I am 
                <b>NOT a scientist, nor a psychologist</b>, nor have I studied productivity. I am simply just some guy who 
                wants to see if the shit I see actually works by sharing results here, and telling my <b>personal</b> opinions 
                as to whether or not you should incorporate it in your life and schedule. This is all just bro-science. Tl;dr 
                this blog is not a full-proof guide to change your life, but moreso a journey to see what ways a person can 
                incorporate tactics that may, or may not, work in your situation. Oh yeah, besides producivity, I may also include 
                posts that are centered around my personal life, and that aren't related to productivity. I am not sure as to what 
                I could blog about, as my personal life isn't all that interesting, but it can be a documentation of how I made a video<sup title="Oh yeah I'm a content creator lmao, channel name is the same as this site">*</sup>
                or some shit. I don't know, but don't expect them to be constant, this blog's primary purpose IS productivity experiments.
                At the end of the day I can always separate them, and make a personal blog and give this blog an official name. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                I have scheduled these blogs to be out every Friday. Not only for consistency reasons, but for me to build a 
                habit of blogging, and not forget about it two days later. Also, you might have noticed that this blog entry 
                is tagged as "personal", well, that's because I want to separate each entry with specific tags. So, you can know 
                if it's an experiment, a habit, or a study hack, a book review, et cetera. They're all gonna be colour-coded for 
                better visibility.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                To end things off, I also want to use this blog to learn how to write. It's a hobby I picked up super recently 
                and I want to get better at it. And, if you're curious, the entry next week is about a book I'm currently 
                reading. I think you'll enjoy it. Oh yeah, if you don't want to miss the review, how about joining my 
                newsletter, eh? ;)
