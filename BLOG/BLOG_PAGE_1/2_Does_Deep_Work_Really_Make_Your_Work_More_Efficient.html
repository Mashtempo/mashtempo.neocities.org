                At the beginning of July this year I decided to take some time out of my day to read Atomic Habits
                by James Clear, and this time, I finally managed to finish reading it. It's a funny story, I 
                actually picked it up I think almost two years ago - when a local bookshop got the first (I think)
                iteration of the Croatian translation of the book. I read the first chapter, gave up, then a year 
                later I read the first chapter, again, and gave up... again. Then almost a year later I picked it 
                up again, this time I read through halfway of the book and, you guessed it... gave up. Again. 
                Well, a month passed this time and I set specific reading times for the book, took short notes, 
                and actually APPLIED the information James Clear had as soon as I read the chapter. And, would you 
                look at that, it actually worked! I finished Atomic Habits for the first time ever and enjoyed the 
                book. I gave it 5 stars on my Goodreads profile, it's a must-read book if you want a simple, yet 
                concise way to build strong habits.<br>
                Now, why did I talk about a completely different book in the intro paragraph of this post? Well, 
                once I finished reading the four main laws of habit building, I went out to get more books in 
                that genre, to maintain a good habit of reading throughout the day. And I found out that there's 
                another bookshop, not too far from me, that has a good amount of books in the popular psychology 
                genre. To my surprise, they had one book that I wanted to get next - Deep Work by Cal Newport. 
                They also had another book that I wanted to get as well, and did; a book titled... wait until the 
                end of the blog post to find out :) (or uhh... go to my Goodreads profile if you're THAT curious) 
                Either way, I bought them as soon as I found out, and set out to read Deep Work once I finished 
                Atomic Habits. And through this blog post I want to answer the question: is this book a must-read, 
                and does it actually help you get more work done in a shorter period of time? 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                First off, I got the Serbian translation of the book - with the publishing company being called 
                Kontrast. They actually make their own covers, and honestly they're not that bad, but I'd prefer 
                if they just made a translation of the official cover of the book. I'm not a design expert, I mean 
                just look at this site, so I'm not gonna judge it harshly, here's the front-cover of the book so 
                you can judge it yourself:
            </p>

            <p class="blog-text">
                Either way, jumping into the book, I had some prior knowledge of its contents and Cal Newport 
                also, so this wasn't that much of a blind read. I mean, you can guess that by the title that it's 
                about doing work... deeply. But I wasn't expecting the book to be 250 PAGES (well, at least the 
                translation of the book), and I feel like the information could've been easily condensed. 
                If you've never read this book, it's actually split into two "sections", or parts - the idea and 
                the rules (these are translations of the Serbian translation, if I get something wrong, uhhh... 
                sorry, I guess?), with the idea having 3 chapters, whereas the rules have 4 chapters. 
                To be more specific, the chapters of the idea are:<br>
                <ol class="blog-text">
                    <li>Deep work is valuable</li>
                    <li>Deep work is rare</li>
                    <li>Deep work is meaningful</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                And, honestly? I think just by reading the chapter names that you can get the general idea of the 
                message: in today's economy you have to value deep work as it is getting rarer and rarer, and 
                replaced with shallow work, like reading emails, constantly getting distracted by social media, 
                etc. Okay, sure, I understand making the first part of the book be an explanation to why the thing 
                you're talking about is useful, but... each chapter is around 20 pages in length... as much as 
                I enjoyed the book (oop, spoiler!), you kinda don't need 20 pages to explain why deep work is 
                important. In fact, I'll explain each chapter in a sentence:<br>
                Deep work is valuable - In an economy where we have to learn and master hard stuff relatively 
                fast, deep work allows us to do just that - it allows us to concentrate on the hard work and get 
                stuff done quicker.<br>
                Deep work is rare - Nowadays actual deep work is rare to achieve as we are using "busyness" as 
                "productiveness" - most people attribute answering e-mails and attending meetings as 
                "productive work", meanwhile it's anything but that, it's shallow and it only distracts us from 
                deep work.<br>
                Deep work is meaningful - While in a state of deep work our mind is gonna understand the world as 
                rich with meaning and thoughtfulness, as it's occupying our mechanisms for attention so that we 
                don't think about something that's not important or having worries about problems in our lives.<br> 
                Yeah, these sentences are quite long, but I think you get the point: these chapters could've been 
                around 10 or so pages long, in my opinion there was no need to go into extreme details about each 
                point. Now, don't get me wrong, I liked reading them, but for 60 pages or so Cal essentially kept 
                repeating how good deep work is. Shit, even in the Introduction I understood the main point - 
                deep work is good, shallow work is bad. <br>
                Continuing on this point, the second part of the book is quite long, too. Now, I understand this 
                as well, and I actually don't mind it that much, for a book in the self-help genre you kinda need 
                to go into detail to explain something so the reader can easily understand the point you're 
                trying to make. But, just like with the first part, some chapters in the second part can drag on. 
                Like, did you know that the first rule - work deeply - is around 50 pages long? Again, I 
                understand the length, Cal actually goes deeply (haha) about the points and gives multiple 
                different examples of deep work and how you can apply it yourself, but I feel like it easily 
                could've been a 30 page chapter. Same as with the rest of the rules, honestly. Like I already 
                said before, the chapters are full of useful information and the examples are great, but in some 
                parts I felt like Cal was just dragging it on and on and on, and I was honestly anticipating when 
                the chapter was gonna end. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                I understand that I am being pretty negative so far, but the truth is I enjoyed this book. 
                I think more people need to work on their ability to work. I've lost count how many times during 
                high school I was working with someone on a project, then, because they open Instagram every 
                couple of minutes, we get distracted and barely do any work on it. It constantly was happening to 
                me, too! I was highly addicted to social media when I started high school, and EVERY single time I 
                wanted to study and got a notification, I'd check it, then at the same time I'll read some 
                comments, maybe watch a TikTok, and oops - three hours have passed. Up until I read this book I 
                was still dealing with distractions I didn't even know I had, and that I didn't even know were 
                hindering me in my ability to get into a flow state of deep work!<br>
                Now, let me use the remainder of this post to talk about the rules to be able to work deeply.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Rule #1 - Work Deeply</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                This is the chapter I said was 50 pages. I know, I have to read words on a page, it's very scary. 
                As I said above, I am still of the opinion that the chapter could've been condensed, but it's a 
                gold mine of good information. I'd go as far as to say that you can only read this chapter if 
                you're unsure of picking the book up. It made me aware of how the body and the mind work and 
                respond to deep work, and how they can negatively affect it if the setup is done poorly. <br>
                We don't have an unlimited amount of attention and focus. In fact, quite the opposite. In a 24 
                hour day you only have a limited amount of focus you can use. The more you use that focus, the 
                more you'll drain it, and if your focus is low, any kind of work becomes miserable to do. As 
                obvious as this sounds, I... didn't know that. Before reading this book I had SO much shit on my 
                to-do list - to program, to write, to read, to edit, to exercise... and I found myself often mad 
                when, after programming, writing, and editing, I couldn't read more than one chapter of Atomic 
                Habits. After 30 minutes or so of reading my mind essentially went "yeah, that's enough for me 
                for today, fuck you" and basically shut down. I was forcing myself to work while my focus was 
                immensely drained. And any reader that wants to work deeply should know about this, so they 
                don't end up in the same situation I was in, as I was genuinely considering giving up.<br> 
                So, what should we do when we drain our focus? Well, Cal says - nothing. 
                Resting is as important as deep work, as it helps us regain the energy we need to do deep work 
                the next day. Not only that, while resting, it can help us think of the problem we're solving 
                during deep work more clearly. And, as Cal says it himself, the work that the majority would do 
                during the evening is probably not that important. Now, I am just a (at the time of writing this 
                lol) teenager with a lot of free time on my hands, I don't constantly check e-mails, but I did 
                overwork myself quite a lot. Let's go back to what I said before, during my reading of Atomic 
                Habits I was implementing a lot of habits that were... surprisingly successful. I was doing every 
                single one of them every single day. But, to repeat myself, I wasn't allowing myself to take a 
                break. I'd constantly work up to 2-3AM, usually editing a video, and not only that, before 
                actually going to sleep, I'd read! I'd read a completely different book - as I wanted to read two 
                books a day - so I'd usually go to bed around 4-5AM. You can guess that type of schedule, no 
                matter how passionate you are, makes you burnt out very easily. After taking a step back, 
                lowering the amount of work I'd do throughout the day and allowing myself to take a break helped 
                me majorly in my quest to be productive. So, if you want any valuable information from me in this 
                post, it is that taking breaks is okay. You're not a piece of code on a machine, you're not a fucking 
                robot, your body needs rest to be able to work efficiently. A "perfect" schedule doesn't exist without 
                a break from work. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Now, as Cal Newport says, there are different types of deep work, or as he calls them 
                "philosophies" of deep work. The majority, I believe, is either gonna use the "monastic" and the 
                "bimodal" philosophy of deep work. The monastic philosophy brings deep work to the maximum by 
                completely eliminating shallow work, or radically lowering the amount of it. That basically means 
                working throughout the day without any distractions. Meanwhile, bimodal philosophy asks you to 
                dedicate a specific defined stretch of time to work deeply, and leaves the rest open to anything 
                else. I think this can be useful to a lot of students and workers, because for example you can 
                define a set amount of time after work, or after school (or even before them if you're that crazy) 
                to dedicate time of undistracted work, so that during the day you can practically do anything else 
                you desire. I, as of writing this post, use the monastic philosophy of deep work. I work a shit 
                ton throughout the day and have minimized the distractions to the fullest - no Discord, no social 
                media, just a computer and a keyboard. But, once university starts, I wouldn't be surprised that 
                I'd need to switch to the bimodal philosophy so that I can have time to work on videos, and this 
                blog.<br>
                Cal lists two more philosophies, which I think for a person just starting to work deeply, like 
                myself, aren't gonna find much usefulness out of it:<br>
                Rhythmic philosophy - to turn deep work into an every day habit. To be completely honest, I see no 
                difference between this philosophy and the bimodal one, as if you dedicate a specific time to 
                doing the work, you're gonna end up building a habit out of it - which is something that I think 
                you should do anyway.<br> 
                Journalistic philosophy - to do deep work whenever we have time on our schedule. So, if I have 
                30 minutes of free time in the day, I'll spend those 30 minutes in deep work doing whatever is 
                necessary in my professional life. If you're new to deep work, I suggest not doing this, as 
                you're still new to deep work and you should only implement this system if it's really necessary, 
                and when you already have the ability to easily get into the state of deep work. Cal also thinks 
                this, too.<br> 
                Remember this: entering deep work is like exercising a muscle. At the start you'll be terrible at 
                it, you'll probably work without distractions an hour max, and that's okay. Using your focus for 
                work is like using your muscles at the gym: at the beginning you'll be sore very fast, but as you 
                consistently exercise your focus, the more you'll be able to work deeply. <br>
                Cal also talks about making rituals to make the best use of deep work. To make a good ritual, 
                you'll need to figure out: <br>
                <b>Where you'll work and for how long?</b> You need to find a workplace and dedicate a certain 
                amount of time to deep work - something like James Clear said about associating certain parts of 
                your house to the habits you want to do. For example, I do all of my work on my personal computer 
                or on my laptop - to be more specific, I edit and write on my PC and program on my laptop. 
                Sometimes I'll even write on my laptop if it's necessary.<br> 
                <b>How will you work?</b> Another personal example, whenever I write, I ban all use of the 
                Internet unless I need to look at my notes, references, or anything else that'll help me with the 
                thing I'm writing. I also cut any other noise and play either brown or green noise to fully 
                concentrate on the work I'm doing.<br> 
                <b>How will you support your work?</b> You need to support your brain so that it keeps operating 
                at a high level of depth. Before I start programming, I drink a cup of tea. Before writing, I eat 
                some food or eat a snack. Before editing, I take a quick walk to clear my mind, etc. Find what 
                works best for you.<br>
                That's the thing you need to keep in mind: <i>find a ritual that works best for you.</i> 
                There's no "best ritual" for everyone, but a best ritual that works specifically for <b>you</b>. 
                It'll probably take a lot of experimenting to find a good ritual for your work.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                The rest of the things Cal touches I won't talk about, as I haven't found any use of them myself. 
                He talks about grand gestures and "4DX" disciplines that can further help you with deep work. 
                If you're interested in it, I suggest picking up a copy and reading it yourself. 
                I might experiment with these and report back here, on the blog post. 
                (and if you want to stay up to date with the posts,

            </p>
            <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Rule #2: Embrace Boredom</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                In Cal's words: we have to get used to being bored. If we constantly check our phones whenever we 
                slightly feel boredom creeping up, then we'll just teach the brain to rely on shallowness. 
                This also negatively affects deep work, as if our brain is relying on shallowness, it's going to 
                be really hard to work without distracting yourself every couple of minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Cal proposes a few ways to overcome the desire for distraction, but not to "embrace boredom". 
                Sure, deep work at first can seem boring, as you're basically receiving delayed gratification 
                instead of instant gratification, like when opening Instagram or Tiktok, which at the beginning 
                can bore you really quick. But, most of the strategies that are listed have anything to do with 
                helping you not check your phone every 5 seconds when you have nothing better to do. 
                Out of all strategies in this chapter, I only use one, and I saw no use of the rest of the methods. 
                So, as with the last rule, I won't be going over them. And if you're curious, again, get the book 
                yourself.<br>
                This strategy is what Cal titled "productive meditation". During any task that isn't cognitively 
                intensive - so physical activities like walking, running, and showering, for example - we put focus on 
                a problem we want to solve. It's just like actual meditation. You pick a problem to solve, and 
                think about it in your head, and when another thought arises you accept that your mind is 
                wandering off, and go back to the initial problem you want to solve. When you try to do this 
                your mind is going to enter what he calls a "closed loop" where the mind wants you to think about 
                the surface level information about the problem. Again, when this happens we accept the fact that 
                we're in the closed loop and try to go deeper into the problem. In my case, I was doing this 
                long before I knew about it. During my time in high school I'd usually go to school by foot as 
                it was a 30 minute trip, and on my walks I'd constantly revise subjects in my head, or think about 
                the stuff I wanted to do after getting home. I was, without even knowing, productively meditating. 
                Maybe this is why I embraced bored so quickly in my journey to productivity - I was already used 
                to it.<br> 
                I'll only briefly mention the other strategies, and I think some people, especially people with 
                jobs, are gonna benefit from some. You can set a specific time where you can use distractions, 
                but during the rest of the day you can't use them at all. So you can take a break from focus. 
                There's a strategy what Cal likes to call the "Roosevelt Sprint", where you calculate how much 
                time it takes for you to finish a certain task that's the highest priority (for example, it may 
                take me around three hours to edit a certain segment in a video), and we assume the lowest 
                possible time to finish that task (I could probably finish editing the segment in two hours, 
                maybe even an hour and a half) - and we try to finish that task as fast as possible. It's 
                important that in the timeframe we can finish that task, or at least be very close to finishing 
                it.<br> 
                Now, the Roosevelt Sprint strategy does certainly work, and I'd like to try it myself and tell 
                you the results, but the last strategy I just don't understand at all - and that's to memorize a 
                deck of cards. He goes into detail about memorising a deck of cards. I think the logic is to 
                train focus through intense memorization, but honestly, the connection to boredom still feels 
                like a stretch to me.<br>
                What I can, from personal experience, suggest though, is that if you want to embrace boredom to 
                try something similar to productive meditation, and that is to just walk and think about your day. 
                Not a certain problem, or a task, just... walk and listen to nature, not music. I think this is 
                the biggest reason as to why I adapted to life without social media, and can relax in silence, 
                because of my everyday walks to school where I refused to listen to music. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                I might be wrong though, maybe the other strategies Cal listed do indeed work, and like I said 
                before I'd like to try them out one day. Maybe whenever I don't forget to buy a deck of cards 
                I'll actually try to remember them.

            <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Rule #3: Quit Social Media</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Oh boy, do I have a lot to talk about this. As I alluded to in the previous rule, I don't use 
                social media. I was heavily addicted to social media. During the day I'd spend hours mindlessly 
                scrolling on Twitter, then before bed I'd mindlessly scroll TikTok. Whenever I was bored, I'd 
                boot up TikTok. It was a huge problem. Then, after I kept getting those "take a break from 
                scrolling" TikToks, I just decided to delete it. After that I then realized how my generation is 
                outright addicted to social media, it's practically a drug at this point. I know I sound like 
                your mom right now, but I can't explain to you how annoying it is to go to dinner with friends, 
                and as soon as we find a place to sit they whip out their phones to answer text messages. So, I 
                am 100% with Cal when he suggests deleting social media. You don't need it. In fact, even 
                shallow stuff, like mindlessly scrolling on TikTok, still drains your focus! That's one of 
                the reasons as to why you feel so tired after watching YouTube all day.<br> 
                Well, when I say that you "don't need social media", it is a little bit far fetched, yeah, as 
                there is some use to them. You can of course use them as tools to aid you in your work, and 
                that's what Cal suggests. Identify your biggest and most important goals in your professional 
                and personal life, along with 2-3 activities that help you to achieve those goals. For example, 
                my goal is to make this a good and reliable blog about productivity, so one of the activities I 
                need to do is constantly read books, research articles, interviews, etc, about habits and staying 
                consistent, and finding ways to experiment and use the information to see if they're viable. 
                Once you've done that, you're gonna think about if the apps you use are helpful towards 
                achieving that goal. Let's go back to my example about this blog, I don't need TikTok, nor 
                YouTube Shorts, or even Instagram Reels. You might say "well you can always find useful TikToks 
                about productivity" and you'd be gravely mistaken! Short form content is meant to entertain, 
                and let me tell you, I've made my feed countless of times to be about motivation and 
                productivity, and through the thousands, maybe at this point hundreds of thousands videos I 
                watched on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, I think I can recall less than 0.5% of the stuff I have 
                seen. Shit, I don't even know what was the last YouTube Short I have watched before 
                disabling YouTube on my phone, yet alone the last 10. <br>
                But of course, there are cases where social media is useful, albeit in very specific cases. 
                In October I'll be attending my first semester of university, and for example, using Instagram is 
                a very good way to connect with fellow students on campus. If I decided to continue being a 
                digital nomad, I doubt I'll have many people wanting to talk to me. Of course though, with these 
                exceptions, work is always more important than shallowly occupying yourself with chatting on 
                Instagram - I'll probably check it once, at most twice a day.<br>
                At the end Cal mentions an experiment, which I think is a good one to do if you're highly addicted 
                to social media. Basically, stop using social media for 30 days without telling anyone. That 
                latter part to Cal is important because it can oftentimes show that a lot of people that follow 
                you kinda don't care about you, as social media makes us believe we are more important than we 
                actually are. After the 30 day period is over, you'll know which app to delete and which one 
                you'll keep; and I doubt you're gonna keep most of them. And if you do keep some - at least you'll 
                be the one in control, not the algorithm.

            <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Rule #4: Drain the Shallows</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                The final chapter talks about how to minimize shallow work as much as possible - literally, as 
                the name suggests, to "drain the shallows". Even if we'd like to spend all day in deep work, the 
                truth is that sometimes we have to dedicate at least some time to answering e-mails, messages and 
                attending meetings.<br> 
                In the first strategy, Cal talks about making a planner, and he REALLY goes into detail about how 
                to make one. First off, he suggests making a planner with pen and paper, not a digital one via 
                Google Calendar, for example. He never explains why, but I think it's because it's easier than 
                doing it digitally. Now, that might not be a case for some, and if you do prefer using Notion or 
                Google Calendar, no one's gonna stop you, but in my case instead of spending at least 30 minutes 
                learning how to use and navigate the app, I just get out a notebook and... write. It's as simple 
                as that. Instead of going on my phone and spending like 5 minutes checking what I have to do, I 
                simply open my notebook and spend at most 10 seconds looking at my planner.<br> 
                The idea behind this planner, as Cal says, is to "plan every minute in your day", and he means 
                that literally. Every minute of your day has to be allocated to something. 
                For example, you might make a timeslot from 1PM to 3PM to finish the chapter of the book you're 
                writing. Now, this doesn't mean that you're gonna spend every minute working, no, it just means 
                that every minute you have something to do - even checking e-mails and other shallow work that 
                you might end up having to do in your day. Also, a thing worth noting is that the goal of this 
                planner is not to have a "perfect" schedule - there might be occasions when you have to stop what 
                you're doing to attend something else, and that's fine - the point is to at all times know what 
                you're going to do with your time. If something slips, just extend the block of time you 
                allocated to the task, or have separate blocks for surprise events. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                To be honest, some of these strategies I will also just gloss over. 
                These strategies are talking about how to minimize the use of e-mail at work, and, well, I am a 
                19 year-old kid who just graduated high school. I can't say if these strategies are any good, or 
                if you should use them. So, like I said before, if you're curious about these, pick up the book 
                yourself.<br> 
                This one can actually be useful if you're a student like me. Basically calculate the deepness of 
                the work you do. Ask yourself "how much time will I need (in months) to teach a worker who just 
                graduated, without specialist teaching in my area, to be in a state where he can do his job 
                correctly?" That way, when you order the time needed to teach this imaginary worker, you can 
                focus your attention on the work that requires more depth. 
                (For example, teaching a new worker the intricacies of editing a video is probably going to take 
                several months, if not a year, whereas making good ideas for a video will take at most a week. 
                That way you're gonna focus more on editing videos, and you can dedicate time for making ideas for 
                those videos once every week or so)
            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
                Now, I would just stop here, but I'd like to talk about just one thing, and that is a subchapter 
                that talks about not being readily available. This chapter is only about e-mail, but it can go 
                beyond that. Simply, when giving your contact, for this example I'll use Instagram, you can tell 
                them "just so you know, I am busy with work throughout the day so I rarely check messages, so it 
                will take some time to respond to them" you'd be surprised how most people respect that decision. 
                Cal talks about making people take more time to write a more thoughtful e-mail, and letting them 
                know that unless they do they won't see it, which is certainly a good way to filter e-mail so you 
                don't spend a who knows amount of time going through them. You can just respond to the ones that 
                pique your attention. <br>
                You can also do this when answering e-mails, to not go about it in too much detail as like I said, 
                I won't, but when answering an e-mail, ask yourself: what's the most efficient way to answer the 
                question in the minimal amount of e-mail messages? Now, Cal suggests this strategy for answering 
                e-mails from coworkers, but there is some use outside of just answering coworkers, it can be used 
                for any kind of occasion for a meeting.

            <h2 class="h2-blog-text">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                In this blog post I went over all of the 4 rules in (mostly) excruciating detail. 
                I talked about the intricacies of deep work, how to apply it and get used to it, and how to 
                minimize distractions. So, would I recommend you to read this book? Personally, I think it's worth 
                reading it. In a world filled with shallow work, deep work can certainly make you stand out, 
                and make making progress much, much easier. It is hard to get used to deep work, but I can't 
                recommend it enough, the struggle is worth it. You won't even realize how much work you'll get 
                done if you apply deep work into your schedule. Even though my main issue with the book is how 
                needlessly long the chapters are, it's still filled to the brim with what I think is really useful 
                information that every worker should apply at least some aspects of it, in both their 
                professional and personal life. There's a reason as to why I gave this book 5 stars on Goodreads, 
                it helped me a ton with getting shit done more efficiently. I think if you're going to buy this 
                book, you should pair it with Atomic Habits if you haven't read it already, it's a good way to get 
                more out of your habits.<br>
                At the beginning of the blog post I also stated that I got another book alongside Deep Work, 
                and that book is 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. I got this book out of general curiosity, as 
                I heard a ton of things about it, and as I was writing this post, I actually read the book! But 
                I won't go and immediately make another book review on it, as I think I need another reread to 
                better understand the laws. I quickly read it and finished the book in 6 days.<br> 
                Welp, that's it for now, hope you found this post informative and helpful, and I hope that I 
                convinced at least one reader to implement deep work in their life.
