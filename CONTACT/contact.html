                Let me say this immediately - <b>there's a very low chance that I'll see your message</b>. 
                During my day I work. I write code, I write words, I edit videos. 
                I read. All of that takes up a good majority of my time. If I were to 
                read e-mails every day, I just wouldn't have time to work on the things I enjoy. 
                So, if you want to contact me, there's a very high chance that I won't respond, 
                yet alone see the e-mail.<br>
                This also goes for social media I have, too. For the same reasons, I am rarely active on Bluesky, 
                RetroAchievements, and even Discord.
            </p>

                If you want to send me any kind of message,
                do it on <a href="mailto:mashtempoyt@gmail.com">mashtempoyt@gmail.com</a>.
                Same goes for my <a href="mashtempo.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, and
                <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Mashtempo">RetroAchievements</a> account, if you don't want to use e-mail.<br>
                As for more serious inquiries, like freelance work for writing, or editing, send me an e-mail at 
                <a href="mailto:sadzake@proton.me">sadzake@proton.me</a>. Alternatively, send me a friend request 
                on Discord, the username is mashtempo.
