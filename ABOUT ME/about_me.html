            <p class="text-content"> Hello there, I am Danin. I'm a student from Bosnia and Herzegovina studying computer science.
                But online, I a more known by my username Mashtempo. I love programming, content creation, and writing, they're big 
                passions of mine. And I want to use this site to share my projects, ideas and thoughts about these said passions and 
                showcase to the world my strengths, but also weaknesses.
            </p>

                I started programming not too long ago. It was actually somewhat on accident. During my primary school education at I.T
                classes I actually majorly despised programming, but as I was deciding on what high school to go to my parents hinted heavily
                that I should study I.T. And that's how I slowly started liking programming. Turns out our I.T teacher was barely teaching 
                programming at all and went over the material in the wrong order. (for loops -> if statements -> functions, etc.) 
                I am currently studying to become a back-end software engineer. I like to write code only, designing was never my forte and 
                I am not fond of it whatsoever, and always look for ways to not do any designs myself. This is the reason as to why I chose to
                make this site have a 90s retro aesthetic. Not only because I quite enjoy the look, but I didn't want to bother using so much
                CSS.

                I have been creating content ever since I was 6. I was exposed to YouTube at a really young age, and throughout my years I was always
                creating something. These were mostly let's plays that required minimal effort to make, and essentially got me nowhere. In 2024, though, I
                decided to dabble in scripted content for the first time ever and actually put effort into my videos. That's how Mashtempo was born. I 
                create videos that are centered around 100%'ing video games. These completion videos are usually about RetroAchievements, but recently I am dabbling in
                Flash content, as well as modern games that are played via the platform Steam. Mashtempo is my first channel ever to get monetized, and is also my biggest 
                channel ever, currently sitting at 2.5k subscribers. My plans are to continue making content until I eventually go full-time. If not, then continuing this as 
                solely a hobby isn't an issue at all, and I am always open for freelancing opportunities.   
            </p>

                Throughout my time I never enjoyed writing. I saw it as something that I was forced to do in school. But during the creation of this site, with the 
                plan to create a weekly blog that is oriented around study and habit hacks, along with general stuff from life, I realized I sparked a passion I didn't 
                even know I had. Besides writing words in a text editor, I create stories that are centered around the genre of horror, and/or thriller. Those are my favourite
                fiction genres, and I want to expand my ideas as actual work I can showcase. My life long goal right now is to have a best-selling book, and I'm hoping to achieve this 
                before I graduate university.

                Besides these main three passions, I enjoy reading. It's a hobby I picked up recently and it slowly became my main source of entertainment. As I stated before, I quite enjoy reading 
                horror and thriller, but I also read books about psychology and self-help/self-improvement, as they majorly helped me in creating good habits and having a stable workflow. Plus, they've been a 
                huge help when it comes to content creation, and they are what I mostly read throughout the day.
                Besides reading, I don't have anything else to write about. I am currently trying to abstain from technology, only using it when I really need it (coding this website, creating videos, writing, 
                recording video footage, etc), and I play video games nowadays solely for content, as they take my time that I could spend working on videos, reading, coding, etc. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
                To end things off, I made this site not only to showcase my work, but to also create a blog that I can share with people. I have taken inspiration from authors Cal Newport and James Clear, and want to 
                create a blog that's centered around study guides and techniques, while also talking about habit building, and other areas that are corelated to the improvement of oneself. These wont be blogs in the sense of 
                "you should do these to succeed", but my general thoughts and how I found them useful, and how you may find them useful and apply it in your own life and shedule. Besides these, I will also write whatever is interesting 
                to me at that time, whether it be something personal that happened, or a video I published, showcasing the process of how I worked on it, or a book review, anything goes. But the core will stay the same - I am intending to make 
                a blog about best and habit forming strategies.
