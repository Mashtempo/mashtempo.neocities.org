            <p class="text-content"> Hello there, I am Danin. I'm a student from Bosnia and Herzegovina studying computer science.
                But online, I a more known by my username Mashtempo. My passions are programming, content creation, and writing, and 
                my use of this site is to showcase my creative work while not only to highlight my strengths, but also document my 
                growth and challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
                I started programming somewhat accidentally. I never enjoyed programming that much, due to the way it was taught in my 
                primary school, with constant switching of topics in a confusing order. But, when it was time to pick a high school, my 
                parents nudged me towards studying I.T., and slowly grew to enjoy it. Today, I'm pursuing back-end software engineering. I 
                like writing logic and code, but design has never been my strong suit, since I have never been a fan of it. That's why my 
                website has a 90s retro aesthetic, both as a creative choice, while also minimizing the use of CSS. (sorry, I'm not a fan)
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
                I have been creating content ever since I was 6. I was exposed to YouTube at a really young age, and throughout my years I was always
                creating something. These were mostly let's plays that required minimal effort to make, and essentially got me nowhere. In 2024, though, I
                decided to dabble in scripted content for the first time ever and actually put effort into my videos. That's how Mashtempo was born. I 
                create videos that are centered around 100%'ing video games. These completion videos are usually about RetroAchievements, but recently I am dabbling in
                Flash content, as well as modern games that are played via the platform Steam. Mashtempo is my first channel ever to get monetized, and is also my biggest 
                channel ever, currently sitting at 2.5k subscribers. My plans are to continue making content until I eventually go full-time. If not, then continuing this as 
                solely a hobby isn't an issue at all, and I am always open for freelancing opportunities.   
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
                Throughout my time I never enjoyed writing. I saw it as something that I was forced to do in school. But during the creation of this site, with the 
                plan to create a weekly blog that is oriented around study and habit hacks, along with general stuff from life, I realized I sparked a passion I didn't 
                even know I had. Besides writing words in a text editor, I create stories that are centered around the genre of horror, and/or thriller. Those are my favourite
                fiction genres, and I want to expand my ideas as actual work I can showcase. My life long goal right now is to have a best-selling book, and I'm hoping to achieve this 
                before I graduate university.
            </p>
            <h3>Other/misc. interests</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
                Besides these main three passions, I enjoy reading. It's a hobby I picked up recently and it slowly became my main source of entertainment. As I stated before, I quite enjoy reading 
                horror and thriller, but I also read books about psychology and self-help/self-improvement, as they majorly helped me in creating good habits and having a stable workflow. Plus, they've been a 
                huge help when it comes to content creation, and they are what I mostly read throughout the day.
                Besides reading, I don't have anything else to write about. I am currently trying to abstain from technology, only using it when I really need it (coding this website, creating videos, writing, 
                recording video footage, etc), and I play video games nowadays solely for content, as they take my time that I could spend working on videos, reading, coding, etc. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
                Other interests of mine include:<br><br>
                Anything retro. I think it's very obvious by now that I enjoy retro stuff. Most of the games that are in my 
                top 10 are retro, my favourite consoles are the PS1, N64, Sega CD and the SNES, I have a giant collecton of retro 
                games in my Steam library, and this site's aesthetic is reminiscent of the 90s. I have no idea how this started. I am 
                not that old, so it's not due to nostalgia reasons. I think it's just my enjoyment of retro is stronger than (most) 
                stuff made nowadays.<br><br>
                Drinking tea. I have been a huge tea drinker for a while now. I have it while I'm programming, while I'm editing, 
                while I'm writing, while I'm relaxing, et cetera. Basically, whenever I'm doing something, I have tea by my side.
                My favourite flavours are green tea (along with pomegranate and lemon flavour!), black tea, hibiscus, jasmine, 
                cranberry, and strawberry with vanilla.<br><br>
                Music. I like listening to music. Just like tea, I listen to music when I do pretty much anything. Editing, programming, 
                chatting with friends, relaxing, playing games, going on walks, et cetera. Lately I've been trying to listen to music 
                less and focus on my thoughts, but music is still important to my every day life. My favourite genres are dark trap, trap metal,
                deathcore, post-hardcore, and any other genres that are similar.<br><br>
                Formula 1. I am actually a new fan to the sport, as I started following it in 2023. Throughout my life I have never 
                liked watching sports, I just couldn't get into it - probably because of how... passionate the people are here when 
                it comes to some sports. The only one that I kinda followed was Tennis, and I still watch a match or two, mainly because 
                my dad is a huge fan of the sport. I like F1 a lot, I am in general a really big fan of racing, so I easily got into the sport. 
                I used to exclusively be a fan of the team Ferrari, but as of 2025 I am just a general fan, usually rooting for the backmarkers.

            <h3>Closing statement</h3>
            <p class="text-content">
                This site doesn't only serve as my personal portfolio, but also a space to reflect, share, and connect. I have been inspired by authors like James Clear and Cal Newport to 
                work on a blog that's focused on studying, habit-building, and systems for personal growth. Instead of giving generic advice, I aim to share what has worked for me, and how 
                you can use it in your own life if it fits your circumstances. Along the way, I'l also write about books, videos, creative projects, or anything else that I find interesting. 
                Although the blog will always be, at its core, about learning, habits, and staying curious.
